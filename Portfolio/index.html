                  <p>The number one question I get is "Can't I just design my own website?  Yes, Yes you can. But here is the deal ..... you only get one chance to make a first impression. The design, layout and usability of your website can either make your sale or break it. <span class="first-impression"> Have you ever been excited to try a resturant, product or service but their website was so convoluted that you changed your mind? Me too!</span></p>

                  <p> For a small investment I will not only design a beautiful website but one that will enhance interest and sales. As a business owner you are already short on time (am I right?) Leave the website to me so you can get back to doing what you do best!</p>
